Menstrual Cycle Tracker using HTML CSS and javascript      
Hosted at: https://nishamanikyala.github.io/MenstrualCycle-Tracker/

NOTE: 1. The length of the menstrual cycle varies from woman to woman, but the average is to have periods every 28 days.
               Regular cycles that are longer or shorter than this, from 23 to 35 days, are normal.
            
      2. If a month has more than 1 date if the cycle length is between 23 to 30 which is less than number of days in a 
               month.
            
      3. This calendar gives dates marked in red from the date you have entered that is +cycle length and -cycle length. So
               these are calculated dates.
